Homework 7

How to Run:
1. Run "make". This will create the executables "shell" and "timekiller"
2. Run "./shell" to start the shell.
3. Included is the timekiller app to test the printouts. I recommend "./timekiller 100 100 1000" with the second input being "1000"
4. Run "stats" in the shell to get the stats on the total runtime from system and user
4. To exit the shell, press ctrl+c

Notes:
1. Programmed on my own ubuntu machine. Last 6 times its worked, so lets shoot for 7
