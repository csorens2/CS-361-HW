HW3 Readme

To Run: 
1. Run "make" to make the file
2. Run "./mandelbrot" to run the program. 
3. Follow the inputs to input the filename for the resulting image (display.txt, result.txt, etc.), xmax, xmin, etc.
4. Do a keyboard interrupt to quit the process. It will output how many pictures you made
5. Resulting pictures will be in the folder with all the files

Grading
It will be very helpful to have the header files to each files open while looking at them. I quite
enjoy using helper functions to keep main clean.

Notes: 
1. This was turned in 1 day late. It is my first of 4
2. This program assumes smart inputs. It can't handle a xmax of "Cookie" for example

Feedback:
With the exception of spending an inordinate amount of time learning how to handle pipes, I overall
rather enjoyed the lab. Perhaps in the future you could provide better documentation for the 
functions that are useful to us in the homework and how to use them in context (IE pipe, write, read, etc.)
