Homework 6

How to Run:
1. Run "make". This will create the executable "master"
2. Run the function with "./master [nBuffers] [nWorkers] [sleepMin] [sleepMax] [randSeed] [-lock | -nolock]"
3. If lock is off, printouts will be made to show data collisions and write errors
4. If lock is on, since there are no collisions or errors, it will instead printout when each child is done to keep track of its progress


Notes:
1. Programmed on my own ubuntu machine. It hasnt caused problems yet, but its worth mentioning
2. "-lock" turns on the semaphores. Anything else put into the parameter will set it to "nolock"
