Readme for Chris Sorenson's (csorens2) HW2

To Run:
1. Run 'make' to make the project. This will create 'keyboard'
2. To run keyboard, type './keyboard X', where X is the time you want between counts
3. To do a keyboard interrupt, press CTRL+C. Follow the prompts to use it

Additional Info
1. For cleaness of data output to the terminal, I have commented out the print out for time child and main slept. 
	To reenable these, scroll to the bottom of keyboard.c and myChild.c and remove the comments beneath the TODO
