Homework 5

How to Run:
1. Run "make". This will create the executable "vmpager"
2. Run the function with "./vmpager 'x' 'y' 'z'", where x is the file to be used, y is the number of memory accesses, and z is the size of the page table. A 'y' of 0 will read the entire file
3. I have diver and drops included to test the algorithm

Analysis
The spreadsheet contains my measurements of the program as well as a graph of the data. My conclusion is that the relationship between the frame table size and the number of misses is logarithmic as the frame table size grows

Notes:
1. Programmed on my own ubuntu machine. It hasnt caused problems yet, but its worth mentioning
2. The exe assumes smart inputs. It cant handle a memory access number of 'pizza'
